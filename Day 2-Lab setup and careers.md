## Careers in Cyber Security

### SOC Analyst
Security Operations Center (SOC) Analysts are responsible for monitoring and managing security incidents in real-time to protect organizational assets. They play a crucial role in identifying and responding to threats.

### Security Engineer
Security Engineers design and implement security solutions to protect networks, systems, and data. They focus on building robust security architectures and ensuring the integrity of security controls.

### Incident Responder
Incident Responders handle the aftermath of security breaches, investigating the cause and impact of incidents, and developing strategies to mitigate future risks. Their role is critical in minimizing damage and restoring normal operations.

### Digital Forensics
Digital Forensic experts investigate cybercrimes by analyzing digital evidence. They play a key role in uncovering details of cyber incidents and supporting legal proceedings.

### Malware Analyst
Malware Analysts examine malicious software to understand its behavior, functionality, and impact. They develop countermeasures to protect systems from malware attacks.

### Penetration Tester
Penetration Testers, or ethical hackers, simulate cyber attacks on systems to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. They provide valuable insights to improve security measures and prevent real-world attacks.
