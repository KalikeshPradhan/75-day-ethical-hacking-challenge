Day 1: Introduction to Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking

Date: [8th July 2024]



---

### Objective:
- Gain a foundational understanding of Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking.

### Key Concepts Covered:

#### 1. What is Cyber Security
Cyber Security involves protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users, or interrupting normal business processes.

#### 2. What is Ethical Hacking
Ethical Hacking is the practice of deliberately probing networks, systems, and applications to find security vulnerabilities that a malicious hacker could exploit. It is performed with the permission of the system's owner to improve the system's security.

#### 3. Difference between Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking
- **Cyber Security:** A broad field encompassing all aspects of protecting digital systems and networks, including threat prevention, detection, and response.
- **Ethical Hacking:** A subset of Cyber Security focused specifically on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities to test and improve security measures.

#### 4. Types of Cyber Security

##### I. Offensive Security (Red Teaming)
- **Definition:** Offensive security involves simulating attacks on systems to uncover vulnerabilities before malicious actors do. This proactive approach helps organizations identify and mitigate security weaknesses.
- **Working:** Red teamers, or ethical hackers, use the same tools and techniques as malicious hackers to test the defenses of an organization. They perform activities such as penetration testing, social engineering, and vulnerability assessments.

##### II. Defensive Security
- **Definition:** Defensive security focuses on protecting systems and networks from attacks. It involves monitoring, detecting, and responding to security threats to prevent breaches and minimize damage.
- **Working:** Defensive security professionals implement security measures, monitor network activity, analyze threats, and respond to incidents. They work to maintain the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information systems.
- **Skills Required:**
  - **Security Operations Centre (SOC):** Monitoring and managing security incidents in real-time to protect organizational assets.
  - **Threat Intelligence:** Gathering and analyzing information about potential threats to anticipate and mitigate attacks.
  - **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR):** Investigating security breaches to understand the cause and impact, and developing strategies to respond effectively.
  - **Malware Analysis:** Examining malicious software to understand its behavior, functionality, and impact, and developing countermeasures.

### Reflections:
Today was an exciting start to the 75-Day Ethical Hacking Challenge. Understanding the basics of Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking has laid a solid foundation for the days to come.

### Next Steps:
- Dive deeper into reconnaissance techniques.
- Explore different types of cyber threats and attack vectors.
- Begin practical exercises to apply theoretical knowledge.
